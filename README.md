# Maze Solver in Python
This project provides solutions to maze-solving using various algorithms, including A* (A-star), BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and Python's maze library.
## Algorithms

### A* Algorithm
- A* (A-star) is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
### BFS Algorithm
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
### DFS Algorithm
- DFS (Depth-First Search) is an uninformed search algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
## Library
- Maze
- queue
- matplotlib
